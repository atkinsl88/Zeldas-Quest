<p><br>Introduction</br></p>
<p>The Kingdom of Hyrule is under attack from the evil Calamity Gannon, who has taken over the divine beasts and guardians, turning them into evil death machines. Zelda, the princess of Hyrule is trapped in Hyrule Castle and needs saving. Help our hero, Link, free the evil from the divine beasts by travelling across Hyrule and defeating Calamity Gannon once and for all.</p>

<p><br>Win</br></p>
<p>Link joins Zelda on her new quest, to restore Hyrule Kingdom and make it even better than it was before. She sets off to start work on maintaining the Divine Beasts and Guardians so that future generations are ready for the cursed threat that will rise again.</p>

<p><br>Loose</br></p>
<p>Unfortunately you didn’t survive the fight, and perished at the hands of Ganon’s evil. Daruk, Urbosa, Mipha, and Revali all had their spirits sealed within the ancient technology as a mutated being, powered by Ganon’s malice, took their place.</p>
